## Farm Boundary Delineation
Farm Boundary Delineation is a sophisticated application designed to identify and outline farm boundaries using advanced image processing techniques. By leveraging statistical methods and Python libraries, this application processes and filters satellite images to achieve precise delineation of farm boundaries.

### About This Application
In agricultural management, accurate delineation of farm boundaries is essential for various applications, including land management, crop monitoring, and resource allocation. This application addresses the need for precise boundary identification by utilizing image processing techniques and statistical analysis on satellite imagery.

### Key Features
* Boundary Delineation: Detects and outlines farm boundaries from satellite images with high accuracy.
* Image Processing: Applies OpenCV and other image processing libraries for manipulation and analysis of raster data.
* Pixel-Level Analysis: Conducts detailed pixel-level operations to enhance image quality and boundary accuracy.
* Data Normalization: Includes processes such as cloud removal and defogging to improve the quality of satellite images.

### Tech Stack
* OpenCV: Utilized for advanced image processing and manipulation techniques.
* Python: The primary programming language used for developing the application and implementing image processing algorithms.
* TIFF Image Format: Used for high-quality raster data handling.
* Image Manipulation: Includes techniques like pixel-level analysis, cloud removal, and defogging.

### Getting Started
Prerequisites
* Python 3.x
* OpenCV
* NumPy
* Raster data libraries (e.g., rasterio)

### Usage
* Prepare Your Data: Ensure that your satellite images are in TIFF format and are pre-processed for optimal quality.
Run the Application:
* python delineation.py
* Process Images: Input your TIFF images into the application.
* The application will perform cloud removal, defogging, and other normalization techniques before processing.

### View Results:
The application will output the delineated farm boundaries, which can be visualized or exported into QGIS as needed.
